# MsPac

## What is this?

MsPac is a package manager written in ruby which tries to mirror
Arch's pacman. It's meant for installing opensource tools from source.
It only supports `git` or `hg` repos at this time. I hope to add `bzr`
and `svn` later. It only supports `apt-get` and `pacman` for
installing dependencies at this time. I hope to add support for
`brew`, `yum`, and `zipper` later.

MsPac installs tools by reading pellet files. The pellets are
contained in a separate repo located
[here](https://github.com/mjwhitta/pellets). It is not safe to assume
that the pellets are stable. Any changes to build instructions, of the
tools themselves, could break MsPac. While I personally wouldn't put
malicous code into a pellet file, it's also not safe to assume I
properly audited any community contributions. I mean, I would hope so,
because I use this myself, but I'm not perfect. Use at your own risk.
